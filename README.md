# Project Overview

## Description

In this project, I explore and address real-world vulnerabilities in the WordPress platform. Instead of uncovering new vulnerabilities, the focus is on demonstrating two specific attack scenariosâ€”Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

## Selected Vulnerabilities

### 1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

   - **Folder:** [Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)](./CVE-2017-5490)
   - **Details:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) via theme name fallback. View the folder for a vulnerability description and exploitation.

### 2. Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)

   - **Folder:** [Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)](./CVE-2019-9787)
   - **Details:** Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) that can extend to Cross-site scripting (XSS). View the folder for a vulnerability description and exploitation.
